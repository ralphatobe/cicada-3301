# The Beginning

This repo really began with my disappointment in the internet. Upon first hearing about [Cicada 3301](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2O7blSSzpI&t=1s), I was interested but I didn't feel any urge to be involved. I mean, it's just some cyber cult looking for electronic escape room masters. But then I saw that they had posted a [cipher](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/the-cicada-puzzles/images/9/95/Gematria_primus.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140109214308) and an encrypted [manifesto](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lkta4q921vliyuw/AADmZ1YUHXWSjSizlMGZHXVMa?dl=0). A manifesto that the internet had not been able to decode entirely (or even mostly).

Taken aback by this sudden shortcoming in the internet's abilities, I decided to take things into my own hands. I printed off the first unsolved chapter and carefully began to transcribe the characters... which lasted all of a minute before I got bored. I knew that, with my technical background, this was a task that I should be able to automate from start to finish.

And here we are!

The posts below outline my journey through the process of creating this repo: challenges, solutions, and results. Feel free to provide insight, and enjoy!
